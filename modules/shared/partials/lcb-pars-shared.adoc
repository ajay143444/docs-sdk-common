You can specify additional options when connecting to the cluster by using the _connection string_.
It indicates to the client where cluster nodes may be found and how to connect to them.
Note that it is common to other Couchbase SDKs as well as the xref:webui-cli-access.adoc[command-line client].
The _connection string_ uses a URI-like format familiar to what is used in other database systems.
